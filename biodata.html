<center> I was born at Hospital Kajang in Kajang, Selangor on 18<sup>th</sup> February 2003

<br><br>

During childhood, I often move from state to other states as my late father was a architect contractor. From 1 years old until 5 years old, I already lived in Selangor, Pahang, and Johor. Luckily, the last place or call it as my home are now located in Negeri Sembilan.

<br><br>
After moving to Negeri Sembilan, I was located at 2nd class in standard 2 at first but moved to 4th class aka second last class as I'm a slow learner which may due to my neurological developmental disability, autism. However, during standard 3, I moved to 2nd class again.

<br><br>
In <b>2015</b>, I was placed in 1st class and sit on UPSR exam. Alhamdulillah, I get 5A for UPSR. However, I only get into usual goverment school instead of MRSM or <i>sekolah berasrama penuh</i> due to poor financial in my family.


<br><br>
In <b>2018</b>, my PT3 results got 5A 3B 1E and get into business, arts, and <i> sains rumah tangga</i> stream

<br><br>
In <b>2021</b>, my SPM results got 6A 1B 1C which I choose this course as my first choice. I also was featured as one of OKU student that have amazing results in SPM on
